### Goodbye American English ###

Changes American spelling to British spelling, this includes changing the season fall to autumn.

Also changes the game units to centimetres, this is not reflected in the intro sign

I've tried to be as thorough as I can but I may have missed some changes, let me know if you spot anything and I'll fix it up.
